Ask Ian Bell the question of whether he ever wants to play for England again and you would get a different answer to the one he would have given a year ago.

It was in August 2017 when Bell and the Warwickshire management came to the mutual decision that it was time for Bell to stand down as captain of the Bears.

Runs in all forms of the game were hard to come by, his dream of winning back his long-standing place in the England middle order looked over - and even Bell admits he contemplated retirement.

A year on, the runs are flowing again, England's middle order is still failing to function properly - and, at the still comparatively tender age of 36, Bell is happy to concede that he still has a hunger to hit the high spots again.

"The questions have started to come a little bit more now, with the form I've had through the season and obviously England's middle order," he told BBC WM.

"If you asked me that question now I would definitely want to play again.

"If you'd asked me that 12 months ago, it would have been a different answer.

"Whether it is with Warwickshire, Birmingham Bears or England, I just still want to be winning games of cricket."
